- Run separate timer for each intent. Literally have an option to run this intent in a timer.
  User can have multiple timers at the same time, browser tabs kind of deal.
  This way a queue will create on it self.
  In timer, set how many iterations you want to do (separate for each intent).
- Timer view -> quick access to notes, tasks of current intent
